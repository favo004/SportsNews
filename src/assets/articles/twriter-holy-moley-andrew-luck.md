That's what the unsuspecting bystanders were saying as Andrew Luck, retired NFL quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, was brutally pelting nearby pedestrians as they stood by. Most people thought of it as quite entertaining. Just an event to draw support to the lesser known dodgeball leagues that play throughout the country. Unfortunately this wasn't just a nice leisure game we used to play in gym class.

After the incident was over and Andrew Luck was detained, we caught up with some of the remainer bystanders to get some of their input on the event.

>_"It was an good show, until he took that little girls head off. Then it was an amazing show"_

>_"I was just so scared. Balls were flying from everywhere. Just balls. Everywhere!"_

No one is very sure as to why Andrew Luck was on such a rampage. Perhaps he is regreting his early retirement. All I know is that this is not acceptable and he needs to release his energy in a more productive manor.
